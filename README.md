Hey there, I am Abir Santra and I love coding, designing and developing stuff! 😄😄❤

I am currently a 4-Star in Problem Solving at HackerRank. I am proficient in C, C++, Java, Python(basics) and JavaScript. I am not really interested in Competitive Programming and Contests but I have a passion for Development instead. I am currently learning Full Stack Web Development with the MERN stack and I am familiar with technologies like HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Node, Express, etc. I also plan to learn App Development in the future. I want to be able to develop awesome Websites and Apps!

I have also been working as a freelance Graphics Designer ever since my school days on Freelancing platforms such as Fiverr and Freelancer. I have worked as a designer for Cryptic Records as well as RadioAktiv Lifestyle, which are both startups. The tools I use mainly include Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, Canva, etc. I am also currently learning UI/UX so that I can implement it while developing websites and apps.

I am fairly positive, strong-willed and I always finish what I start. It is my dream to be happy in life and work at a job where I get to do what I love i.e. designing and developing stuff. In my leisure time I love to hangout with my awesome friends and play video games, build various kinds of projects, play the drums, watch Anime and anything related to Japan because I love Japan ❤

That's it! Thank you for checking out my profile and reading through all of that.😅😅 
Have a wonderful day ahead! 😄😄😊😊
