**I'm a simple guy with a passion for development and design. I enjoy creating things out of code.**

<br>

## 💫 About Me:

Hi there! I’m Abir, a web designer and developer who has been tinkering with code since high school, and it has been my passion ever since!
<br>
When I’m not coding, you can find me hanging out with my friends, playing video games, listening to music, jamming on my drums, or watching Anime. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I'm excited about the possibilities that the future holds, and I can't wait to see where my coding journey takes me!

<br>
